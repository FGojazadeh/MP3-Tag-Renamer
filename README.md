# MP3-Tag-Renamer
This application allows user to automatically rename .mp3 files according to its IDv3 tags. 
For example 054515351.mp3 will be renamed to Evanescence - My Immortal.mp3 considering that its IDv3 tag contains "Artist: Evanescence" and "Title: My Immortal"
At the moment application is working properly only with files which artist/title is in english encoding.
Due to my lack of experience, right now I'm trying to find out a solution for this, but I will be glad for any suggestions and help in the issue.
Please feel free to use this project for any purposes, since it's absolutely open-sourced.
